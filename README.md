‚å®Ô∏è CMD+K your way around Craft!

## ü§î What is Palette?
Palette allows you to easily jump to specific areas within Craft without lifting your hands off the keyboard!

That's the elevator pitch, at least. But, sometimes, you just need a visual:

If you're a developer, you likely use similar shortcuts today in apps like:

- VS Code
- Slack
- Alfred or Raycast
- ...and many, many others

It should also exist in the CMS you use most, right?
